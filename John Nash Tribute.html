            <p>John Forbes Nash Jr. (June 13, 1928 â€“ May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions
                to game theory, differential geometry, and the study of partial differential equations. Nash's work has provided
                insight into the factors that govern chance and decision-making inside complex systems found in everyday
                life.
            </p>
            <p>His theories are widely used in economics. Serving as a Senior Research Mathematician at Princeton University
                during the latter part of his life, he shared the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with game
                theorists Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi. In 2015, he also shared the Abel Prize with Louis Nirenberg
                for his work on nonlinear partial differential equations.</p>
            <p>Nash was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia. His father, John Forbes Nash, was an electrical
                engineer for the Appalachian Electric Power Company. His mother, Margaret Virginia Nash, had been a schoolteacher
                before she married. He was baptized in the Episcopal Church.</p>
            <p>Nash's adviser and former Carnegie professor Richard Duffin wrote a letter of recommendation for Nash's entrance
                to Princeton stating, "He is a mathematical genius."Nash was also accepted at Harvard University. However,
                the chairman of the mathematics department at Princeton, Solomon Lefschetz, offered him the John S. Kennedy
                fellowship, convincing Nash that Princeton valued him more. Further, he considered Princeton more favorably
                because of its proximity to his family in Bluefield. At Princeton, he began work on his equilibrium theory,
                later known as the Nash equilibrium.</p>
            <p>Nash earned a Ph.D. degree in 1950 with a 28-page dissertation on non-cooperative games. The thesis, written
                under the supervision of doctoral advisor Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of the
                Nash equilibrium, a crucial concept in non-cooperative games. It won Nash the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic
                Sciences in 1994.</p>
            <p>In 1951, Nash was hired by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a C. L. E. Moore instructor in
                the mathematics faculty. About a year later, Nash began a relationship in Massachusetts with Eleanor Stier,
                a nurse he met while admitted as a patient. They had a son, John David Stier</p>

                now called Nash Equilibria. He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1999.</p>
            <p>In 1994, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (along with John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten)
                as a result of his game theory work as a Princeton graduate student. In the late 1980s, Nash had begun to
                use email to gradually link with working mathematicians who realized that he was the John Nash and that his
                new work had value. They formed part of the nucleus of a group that contacted the Bank of Sweden's Nobel
                award committee and were able to vouch for Nash's mental health ability to receive the award in recognition
                of his early work</p>
            <p>Nash received an honorary degree, Doctor of Science and Technology, from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999,
                an honorary degree in economics from the University of Naples Federico II on March 19, 2003,[42] an honorary
                doctorate in economics from the University of Antwerp in April 2007, an honorary doctorate of science from
                the City University of Hong Kong on November 8, 2011,[1] and was keynote speaker at a conference on game
                theory. He has also been a prolific guest speaker at a number of world-class events, such as the Warwick
                Economics Summit in 2005 held at the University of Warwick. In 2012, he was elected as a fellow of the American
                Mathematical Society. On May 19, 2015, a few days before his death, Nash, along with Louis Nirenberg, was
                awarded the 2015 Abel Prize by King Harald V of Norway at a ceremony in Oslo.</p>
            <p>In 1959, Nash began showing clear signs of mental illness, and spent several years at psychiatric hospitals being
                treated for paranoid schizophrenia. After 1970, his condition slowly improved, allowing him to return to
                academic work by the mid-1980s.[4] His struggles with his illness and his recovery became the basis for Sylvia
                Nasar's biography, A Beautiful Mind, as well as a film of the same name starring Russell Crowe as Nash.</p>
            <p>On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife were killed in a vehicle accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Monroe Township,
                New Jersey. </p>
